Hermes correctly stopped its resumed gate on unformatted new Rust tests. Sol alone may
make the seven-path formatting-only repair. The uncommitted lock resolution and Hermes
evidence are preserved and read-only. Production, test execution, integration, and the
real local-Monero gate remain unauthorized.
