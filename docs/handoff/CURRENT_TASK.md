Ticket: [BBD-WAL-006.md](../../tickets/BBD-WAL-006.md)

BBD-WAL-004 remains complete and reviewer-accepted at `e8894a44`. BBGO-PAY-001 remains
complete in `../bb-go` at production `6bbb0629` and final evidence `801f5d55`.

The exact eight uncommitted Phase-A test/manifest paths passed semantic source review and
the corrected formatter gate exited 0. The next lock-resolution command stopped before
lock mutation: Zcash's exact `bip32 0.6.0-pre.1` requires prerelease
`hmac 0.13.0-pre.4` and `sha2 0.11.0-pre.4`, which Cargo cannot resolve beside the
accepted stable WAL-004 `hkdf 0.13.0`/`sha2 0.11.0` graph.

Sol is authorized to change only the Node test-side WAL-004 dependency expectation and
add four exact, non-vacuous pin mutations under the active handoff. Manifest, production
policy, Rust source/tests, lockfile, fixtures, execution, evidence, integration, and Git
remain frozen. Luna's Phase-B resume handoff is suspended until the correction test is
reviewed, run red, integrated, followed by a separately authorized manifest/policy
correction and exact custody-vector gate.

No production source or policy implementation is authorized. XHigh must accept the
resolved graph, fixture bytes/provenance, and exact expected-red evidence before a
separate Phase-C source handoff exists. No broader tests, falsification, live endpoint,
mainnet, signing, proving, extraction, broadcast, hardware, Electron, package, SBOM, or
other-repository work is authorized in this phase.

This slice remains offline and synthetic. `../go-ipfs` is deprecated and receives no
wallet work.
